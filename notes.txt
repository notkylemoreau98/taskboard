    - Taking all of the code for a certain feature and putting it into one place
    - Can be used for stuff like settings, authentication, projects (pages)

    - Something like a nav or a header / sidebar
    - For stuff used in a lot of places
Components
    - For highly used small pieces of code
Lib
    - For 3rd party libraries
    - You would want to use something like a fetch function here or something like axios
